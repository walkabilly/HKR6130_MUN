## HKR 6130 Week 1 

## Introduction

This week we will focus on reading a discussing the conceptual and general measurement issues related to physical activity and location data, what Jankowska et al., have described as "spatial engergetics". The papers are desiged to get us thinking about we mean when we say physical activity, spatial location, and how we can combine the two.

## Objectives

1. Introduce yourself.
2. Think physical activity. 
3. Write a short reflection blog post.

## Reflection Questions

1. What are the advantages/challenges of using accelerometers to collect physical activity data?
2. Do accelemeroters change our conception of what reliability and validity mean for physical activity measurement?
3. How could would you measure physical activity if you had to? In a classroom? In older adults? 

## Regular Assignment 1

1. Make a 1-2 minute video introducing yourself to the class. Post a link to the Intro Video Forum on BrightSpace.
