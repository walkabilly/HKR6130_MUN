## HKR 6130 Week 3  

## Introduction

This week we will focus on reading a discussing intervention design. We will focus on quasi- and natural experiments for this course. These designs are useful in the educational and built environment research context and will provide a good framework for thinking about intervention more generally. There are 2 readings specifically related to interventions in the educational settings. 

During the readings spend some time thinking and writing about what you would like to do for your intervention study proposal. The goal is provide a proposal that will allow me to have sufficient information to create a plausible dataset that you will have to use for intervention evaluation report. 

## Objectives  

1. Think about intervention design
2. Start planning your intervention
3. Write a short reflection blog post.
